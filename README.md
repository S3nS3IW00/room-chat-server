# Server for room based chat application

This is the Spring Boot server to my [room chat app](https://github.com/S3nS3IW00/room-chat-app).

It uses REST API for create room and room check room existence.
For real-time chatting experience, it has a STOMP websocket connection aswell.
It stores everything in memory.
